# JumpLister
BepInEx plugin that adds useful options to the game's Jump List (right click in taskbar).

So far only works in HoneyCome, DigitalCraft and SamabakeScramble.
There seems to be a bug in Unity Mono that hard crashes the game whenever the JumpList API is used, but it works fine in IL2CPP because a modern runtime is used instead.
